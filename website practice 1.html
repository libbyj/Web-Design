    <h1>Cabernet Franc</h1>

    <h2>About the Grape</h2>
    <p>This is a grape that is a Bordeaux variety and used to be used mainly as a blending grape. Now, especially in cooler climates, it grows well enough to be its own wine.	Wines made from Cab Franc are generally spicy, with dark red fruits. </p>
    <p>New world wines that are made from Cab Franc are found in:
	<ol>
		<li> Virginia,</li>
		<li> cool climates such as New York's finger lakes,</li>
		<li>and several west coast appelations. </li>
	</ol>
    </p>

<br>
    <h2>Breaux Cab Francs</h2>
    <p>At Breaux Vineyards, we make a traditional Cabernet Franc called <em>Marquis de Lafayette</em>.  
	In years that we feel the fruit warrants it, we also make a Cabernet Franc Reserve, such as the notable 2007 vintage.
	The warm 2012 vintage has inspired us to add a third wine to our Cab Franc lineup, the Marquis de Lafayette Reserve. </p>
